# team-vault

Using [`age`][age] to protect & share secrets across a small team.

[age]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age

- age replaces GnuPG as a [simpler, better](#why-not-gpg-pass-or-gopass) encryption tool.
- The scripts offered here are very thin wrappers around age,
    only concerned with improving user experience for specific use-cases.

## How to

### Join an existing vault

For this operation, you need an already-enrolled colleague.

1. [Install `age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age#installation).
2. Run `./cmd/enroll-myself-in-team-vault`.
    - It creates a `.my-secret-identity` file that **must not be shared**.
        You can back it up (securely) though.
    - It displays your public key, but you don’t need to remember it.
    - It adds your public key to `teams.identities`, which lists everyone
        for whom the secrets in this vault are encrypted.
    - Take the opportunity to open `team.identities` and remove
        the keys of people who have left the team.
3. Publish your changes (no need for a pull request yet):
    - `git add team.identities && git commit -m 'adding my public key' && git push origin YOUR_NAME`.
4. Ask your colleague to:
    1. Pull your changes: `git fetch && git checkout YOUR_NAME && git diff main`.
    2. Run `./cmd/reencrypt-all-team-secrets SECRET_DIRECTORY`.
    3. Commit, push, review, and merge.

You can optionally add `./cmd` to your path
(to avoid having to `cd` here before reading/writing secrets).
Depending on your shell, run:

- bash: `echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$(pwd)/cmd\"" >>~/.bash_profile`
- zsh (macOS): `echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:$(pwd)/cmd\"" >>~/.zprofile`
- fish: `set -a fish_user_paths (pwd)/cmd`

### Decrypt a secret

Use **read-team-secret**:

```bash
$ ./cmd/read-team-secret secrets/some-file
```

### Create or update a secret

Use **upsert-team-secret**, which reads your cleartext value from stdin:

```bash
# Note the initial whitespace to avoid recording the secret in your shell history.
$  echo "secret!" | ./cmd/upsert-team-secret secrets/some-file
```

You can also simply provide the secret value after starting the command.
Enter the value followed by a newline and Ctrl-D to finish:

```bash
$ ./cmd/upsert-team-secret secrets/some-file
   # ← blank line waiting for your input
```

### Editing a secret

To edit a secret with your default $EDITOR use `./cmd/edit-team-secret`:

```bash
$ .cmd/edit-team-secret secrets/some-file
```

The secret is updated when you exit your editor.

#### Warning
Your `$EDITOR` might create some temporary files with the decrypted content.
Please refer to your editor's documentation for how to disable that behaviour
and other best practices. The following is a non exhaustive list of recommendations:

- [vim](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Encryption)
- nano: set `$EDITOR` to `nano -R`


### Create a completely new vault

1. [Install `age`](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age#installation).
2. Move in the directory that will be your vault.
3. Copy the scripts and supporting files from this repository:

    ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/thilp/team-vault/tarball/main | tar -xz --strip-components=1
    ```

4. Run `./cmd/enroll-myself-in-team-vault`.
4. Start encrypting things with [`upsert-team-secret`](#create-or-update-a-secret).
5. Commit and push all the changed files to your git server.

## FAQs

### Why is the private key not password-protected?

It wouldn’t provide meaningful security:

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29600122

### Why not rely on GitHub keys?

[githubkeys]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age#encrypting-to-a-github-user

age has that [cute feature][githubkeys] (because it also supports SSH keys):

```bash
$ curl https://github.com/benjojo.keys | age -R - example.jpg >example.jpg.age
```

We could replace `team.identities` with a simpler list of GitHub usernames!

Unfortunately we rely on a GitHub Enterprise that requires an API token to
access the equivalent URL, making it much less practical.
And relying on GitHub.com instead would often mean dealing with confusing
hacker handles instead of clean, predictable enterprise usernames.

### About alternatives

#### Why not [gpg][], [pass][], or [gopass][]?

[gpg]: https://gnupg.org/
[pass]: https://www.passwordstore.org/
[gopass]: https://github.com/gopasspw/gopass

Both pass and gopass rely on GPG for encryption, and GPG [is][schneier]
[really][latacora] [pretty][signify] [bad][green].

[schneier]: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/12/giving_up_on_pg.html
[latacora]: https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html#encrypting-files
[signify]: https://www.openbsd.org/papers/bsdcan-signify.html
[green]: https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2014/08/13/whats-matter-with-pgp/

Also, my `gpg --list-secret-keys` says I should be able to decrypt things,
but I can’t because (a pause of 3 seconds and some obscure error message about
files not found). And nobody on or off the internet seems to know why.
I tire of parleying with that unhelpful, complicated tool.

(gopass has tentative support for [age][], but it crashed immediately when I
tried to use it.
pass has [a fork that replaces gpg with age][passage], written by age’s creator,
but the size of its userbase is unclear and it doesn’t seem to add significant
features compared to age alone.)

[passage]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage

#### Why not [SOPS][]?

[sops]: https://github.com/mozilla/sops

It supports [age][]!
(It even says "It's recommended to use age over PGP, if possible.")
But it also asks you to provide the list of recipients with such a clumsy
interface (explicitly listing keys in a flag or an env var) that I’d have to
write a wrapper to make that UI usable in our CLI use-case; at which point I
can cut the middle-man and just wrap age directly.

Its value seems to be in the fact that it supports multiple (and so many) ways
to encrypt your secrets, especially for cloud deployments.
That’s simply a different use-case.

#### Why not [KeePassXC][]?

[keepassxc]: https://keepassxc.org/

You still need to securely share the password protecting the database.
And it’s not easy to 4-eyes review changes to that database.

#### Why not KMS or AWS Secrets Manager?

It replaces simple-if-tedious key distribution via git
(`cmd/enroll-myself-in-team-vault` + `cmd/reencrypt-all-team-secrets`)
with an AWS IAM setup that may be as tedious or even impossible to achieve.

Where I work, the exclusive reliance on AWS roles and the central provisioning
of these makes it impossible for us to have a KMS key usable only by members of
our team.

#### Why not Google Docs?

One big file, no encryption to deal with, and access control managed at the
individual or team level.
It’s searchable and versioned just like our git repository, and it’s trivially
cross-platform.
Sounds great!
You can even appeal to your Google admins to get the secrets back if somehow
everyone loses access.

Downsides:

- It’s all online, so you can’t use it without internet access.
    But most secrets would probably be useless (to you) in that case anyway;
    hence likely not a real issue.
- If Google Docs is down, you can’t access your secrets.
    They have an availability SLA of [99.9%][google-sla]
    (allowing for around 9 hours of downtime per year), which many teams could
    consider acceptable for that use-case, and others wouldn’t.
- If someone’s Google account gets compromised and they have access to the
    document containing all secrets, these secrets are compromised too.
    This is similar to that person instead using gpg/age and having their
    laptop (filesystem) compromised.
    Both cases seem unlikely given the enforcement of multi-factor
    authentication in Google accounts, and of typical enterprise security
    measures in laptops (plus the effort of deploying malware or physical presence).
    I don’t know how much more likely each is compared to the other.
    If your laptop is compromised, so too is your Google account, probably?
- **Either all editors of the document can share it further, or only the owner can.**
    **And there is no (easily accessible) record of with whom it was shared when.**
    This is for me a clear disadvantage compared to git-backed methods:

    - If all editors can share (the default), then a single rogue editor
      can add anyone else to the list and no-one notices for a long time.
    - If only the owner can share, they’re a single point of failure and
      any availability on their side translates in delays.
      And the owner can still be rogue (see above).
    - If a few people are editors (and can share) while the rest of the
      team can only view/comment, you still have (fewer) points of failures
      but you’ve also created a probably-unwelcome "hierarchy of trust" in
      your team.
